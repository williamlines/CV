## About Me

A highly motivated Software Engineer with the capacity to produce high-quality, test driven code. I have worked with many different languages and frameworks, and learned them fast enough to deliver on a two week project.
A background in Mathematics laying the groundwork for the logical and pragmatic mindset necessary to thrive as a Software Engineer, combined with a history of hospitality work has shaped me into a personable team member with a strong desire to share knowledge, and pair with other Developers. I am a valuable asset in making a team reach its goals.
I find immense satisfaction in solving a hard problem- this was paramount to my success at University studying Maths, and is what drives my passion for technology.

<!--[OLD] I'm Will, an analytically minded recent Maths graduate looking for new opportunities in the world of tech. Having got a taste of coding and a good helping of logic and analysis in my maths degree, I am eagerly expanding my skill set and look forward to an exciting career in tech! -->

#### Collaboration

- I have a breadth of collaborative experience working quickly and efficiently as a team in my bar job, as well as long term group projects in my university degree creating and presenting a business plan to mock investors.
- While at Makers, I often engaged in pair programming while working on projects, this would make building code from scratch fly by!
- Using mobbing as a quick solution to overcome obstacles when working in a small team.

#### Communication

- Clear and concise communication is pivotal to fulfilling my roll as bar staff, having no problem taking and fulfilling orders in a buzzing, extremely busy environment.
- Took part in presenting projects in my university degree on many occasions, presenting to large and smaller audiences, taking and answering questions.
- Knowledge sharing while working on a project at makers to promote a culture of collaboration and mutual support within a team.

#### Thrives in High-Pressure Environments

- At Makers I had 8 days to Brainstorm an idea, and build it whilst simultaneously learning new tech to make it work.

<!-- - I had to fulfil orders quickly in a busy bar environment.
