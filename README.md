## About Me

I am a Full-Stack Developer who is both logical and able to adapt, and recent Maths Graduate with a knack for picking up new skills fast.

After having a taste of coding in my degree, I knew that tech was the direction I needed to go. I am eagerly expanding my skill set to better prepare for an exciting career in tech!

#### Collaboration

- I have a breadth of collaborative experience working quickly and efficiently as a team in my bar job, as well as long term group projects in my university degree creating and presenting a business plan to mock investors.
- While at Makers, I often engaged in pair programming while working on projects, this would make building code from scratch fly by!
- Using mobbing as a quick solution to overcome obstacles when working in a small team.

#### Communication

- Clear and concise communication is pivotal to fulfilling my roll as bar staff, having no problem taking and fulfilling orders in a buzzing, extremely busy environment.
- Took part in presenting projects in my university degree on many occasions, presenting to large and smaller audiences, taking and answering questions.
- Knowledge sharing while working on a project at makers to promote a culture of collaboration and mutual support within a team.

#### Thrives in High-Pressure Environments

- At Makers I had 8 days to Brainstorm an idea, and build it whilst simultaneously learning new tech to make it work.
