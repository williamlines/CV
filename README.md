## About Me

A highly motivated Software Engineer with the capacity to produce high-quality, test driven code. I have worked with many different languages and frameworks, and learned them fast enough to deliver on a two week project.
A background in Mathematics laying the groundwork for the logical and pragmatic mindset necessary to thrive as a Software Engineer, combined with a history of hospitality work has shaped me into a personable team member with a strong desire to share knowledge, and pair with other Developers. I am a valuable asset in making a team reach its goals.
I find immense satisfaction in solving a hard problem- this was paramount to my success at University studying Maths, and is what drives my passion for technology.

## Work Experience

**Shellfish Cow** ( 2021 to 2022)  
_Bar Staff_

- High-pressure customer facing environment demanding clear communication with customers and coworkers to provide quality service.
- Having to perform tasks quickly and to a high standard while effectively managing time in order to keep the bar running smoothly.
- Trusted with opening and closing duties and running the bar alone.
- Attention to detail when fulfilling an order to deliver a pleasant customer experience.
- Adapting to fill multiple roles when the situation demands, for example waiting on a table when a server is not available.

## Skills

#### Collaboration and Communication

- I have a breadth of collaborative experience working quickly and efficiently as a team in my bar job. Clear and concise communication was pivotal to fulfilling my roll as a member of the team, having no problem taking and fulfilling orders in a buzzing, extremely busy environment.
- I thrive in the Agile working environment. Running a self-enforced Agile style with rotating scrum masters for each sprint facilitated the delivery of key features, whilst preventing burnout.
- Throughout my time at Makers, particularly the final project, I often engaged in pair programming whilst working on a project. This would make building code from scratch fly by, and allowed me to empathise and understand my work partner, resulting in better code.
- Using mobbing as a quick solution to overcome obstacles when working in a small team. This practice played a large role in the success of our final project, given the short duration of the development sprints.
- Took part in presenting projects in my university degree on many occasions, presenting to large and smaller audiences, taking and answering questions. In one case we presented a business plan to a panel of mock investors and took questions. It was crucial to keep the presentation running smoothly for my answers to be quick, clear and concise.
- Knowledge sharing while working on a project at makers to promote a culture of collaboration and mutual support within a team. An environment where everyone feels they can ask for help is a healthy and productive one, and another big contributor to my success in group work.

#### Thrives in High-Pressure Environments and Fast Learner
