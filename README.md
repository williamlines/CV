## About Me

A highly motivated Software Engineer with the capacity to produce high-quality, test driven code. I have worked with many different languages and frameworks, and learned them fast enough to deliver on a two week project.\
A background in Mathematics laying the groundwork for the logical and pragmatic mindset necessary to thrive as a Software Engineer, combined with a history of hospitality work has shaped me into a personable team member with a strong desire to share knowledge, and pair with other Developers. I am a valuable asset in making a team reach its goals.\
I find immense satisfaction in solving a hard problem- this was paramount to my success at University studying Maths, and is what drives my passion for technology.

## Work Experience

**Shellfish Cow** ( 2021 to 2022)  
_Bar Staff_

- High-pressure customer facing environment demanding clear communication with customers and coworkers to provide quality service.
- Having to perform tasks quickly and to a high standard while effectively managing time in order to keep the bar running smoothly.
- Trusted with opening and closing duties and running the bar alone.
- Attention to detail when fulfilling an order to deliver a pleasant customer experience.
- Adapting to fill multiple roles when the situation demands, for example waiting on a table when a server is not available.

## Skills

#### Collaboration and Communication

<!-- PICK THE BEST OF THESE!!! -->

- I have a breadth of collaborative experience working quickly and efficiently as a team in my bar job. Clear and concise communication was pivotal to fulfilling my roll as a member of the team, having no problem taking and fulfilling orders in a buzzing, extremely busy environment.
- I thrive in the Agile working environment. Running a self-enforced Agile style with rotating scrum masters for each sprint facilitated the delivery of key features, whilst preventing burnout.
- Throughout my time at Makers, particularly the final project, I often engaged in pair programming whilst working on a project. This would make building code from scratch fly by, and allowed me to empathise and understand my work partner, resulting in better code.
- Using mobbing as a quick solution to overcome obstacles when working in a small team. This practice played a large role in the success of our final project, given the short duration of the development sprints.
- Took part in presenting projects in my university degree on many occasions, presenting to large and smaller audiences, taking and answering questions. In one case we presented a business plan to a panel of mock investors and took questions. It was crucial to keep the presentation running smoothly for my answers to be quick, clear and concise.
- Knowledge sharing while working on a project at makers to promote a culture of collaboration and mutual support within a team. An environment where everyone feels they can ask for help is a healthy and productive one, and another big contributor to my success in group work.

#### Thrives in High-Pressure Environments and Fast Learner

<!-- - At Makers I had 8 days to Brainstorm an idea, and build it while simultaneously learning new tech to make it work.  -->

<!-- WORK ON THIS ONE !! -->

- For the Acebook project, I had to learn the MERN stack and use it to build an app from a basic codebase in only two weeks. Visualising the framework through diagramming helped me gain an understanding of how it functioned, and with the use of the React docs, and manipulating the bases existing code, delivered on the project.
